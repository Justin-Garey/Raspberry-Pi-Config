# Raspberry-Pi-Config
Anything to do with my Raspberry Pi(s) is in this repository for safe keeping.

## How-Tos

[Overclocking](./overclocking.md) instructions for a Pi 4b and 3b+

## Addons

Every [case](./cases.md) I've used for the RPi and their characteristics are listed for quick setup, reference, or finding one for a future project. 

## Other

For clarification, when someone refers to the Pi 4, they are referring to the Pi 4b as that is the only Pi 4 model.
